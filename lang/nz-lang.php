define('comm12','Where do I start...? First of all, very good contact with customer service (DHL had lost my package). This problem was resolved very quickly to my satisfaction. The use is really easy as you just need to take it once a day with a glass of water. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t feel anything during the first week and my motivation was at its lowest. I thought about stopping the treatment because it wasn&#039;t working for me. However, the many customer comments gave me hope and I continued to take it. During the second week, my husband noticed that I was eating much less (he only noticed because he does the dishes in our house and my plates were not empty). This really surprised me. I don&#039;t weigh myself often (only once a month) and I did the same when I was using it. After the package (I only ordered one), the scale showed 7 kg less. This is a good success for me, as I usually have trouble losing weight. I just ordered the second package and I&#039;m writing this review to thank you (and to encourage other users). My husband is also positively surprised, but we (or I) have not yet reached our goal and we will try another package. Greetings from the Black Forest, Ricarda ');

define('comm14','I have been taking the tablets for a few days now and I must admit that I feel like it is working. It is good that the gummies
 are caffeine-free, which allows for good sleep and losing a little weight at the same time. I think it&#039;s great :-)');
